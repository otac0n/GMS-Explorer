# GMS Explorer
GMS Explorer is a program to open, view, extract, and edit the contents of data.win files of Game Maker Studio games. This is intended to be a more full-featured successor to [GMExtract](https://github.com/puggsoy/GMExtract).

## Credit
A large portion of the information used to reverse-engineer the format is from PoroCYon [here](https://github.com/puggsoy/GMExtract) and Mirrawrs [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20170905005557/http://undertale.rawr.ws/unpacking). Big thanks to them for figuring out and sharing this much.

## Current Status
Can read GEN8, TXTR, TPAG, and SPRT chunks. Basically no UI, just a button that tests stuff.
